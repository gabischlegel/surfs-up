## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to help W.Avy figure out if his surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. I compared December to June to see what the weather was like 6 months apart in the winter and in the summer. 

## Results
-	As we see in the below chart, the high in June is 85 and the low is 64. The average is 75 meaning June would be a great month to have the Surf and Ice Cream shop open.

-	As we see in the below chart, the high in December is 83 and the low is 56. The average is 71 meaning December would also be a good month to have the Surf and Ice Cream shop open if it doesnâ€™t dip too low.

-	Although the highs are quite similar between the two months with June only being 2 degrees warmer, the low in December is 9 degrees colder than in June. But the standard deviation for December (3.75) has much more promise that the weather will fluctuate. The standard deviation in June is slightly lower at 3.25. 

## Summary
The weather is very similar between December and June, with December being slightly colder but not too cold. The surf and ice cream shop would do well being open year-round with it being slightly more popular in the summer months than winter according to the data. 
I would like to do more research and run two new queries to compare precipitation between the two months. If one month is drastically higher in precipitation it would hurt the stores sales. I would also analyze tropical storms that hit in June and December to see when they are the most frequent. Surfers can surf in the rain, but a tropical storm could wipe out the business.
